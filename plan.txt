Step 1: Data Generator

A text generator that describes one or two objects with properties
that are chosen randomly:

Color: red, blue, green
Size: small, medium, large
Shape: square, circle, triangle

Objects can be in one of the following relationships:

Spatial: on, near, above

Text generation is controlled by these parameters:

p_one: probability of one object (instead of two)
p_color: probability that color is mentioned for an object
p_size: probability that size is mentioned for an object
p_rel: probability that, if there are two objects, a spatial
relationship is mentioned

Generation goes as follows:
(1) Select the number of objects 
(2) If there are two objects determine if the relationship is
mentioned
(3) For all objects, determine if size and color are mentioned

Each object will create text like this:

a size color shape

where size and color are filled in if they are mentioned.

If there are two objects the sentence will be

a size color shape rel a size color shape

If the spatial relationship is mentioned fill it in, otherwise rel
will be "and"

There should be a config dictionary that includes the parameters above
that is passed to a generate function along with the desired number of
sentences.

There should also be a python script that takes as input a json config
and a number of senetences and generates them to standard out
