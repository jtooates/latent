This document describes a data generator for physical scenes.

Each scene will contain one or two objects.  Each object has a shape,
and can optionally have a size and/or color.

If there are two objects they will have a spatial relationship.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
- Language: Python
- Config file format: JSON
- Interface: Both library and CLI tool
- CLI should use argparse, accept config file path, and support:
  * -o/--output flag for output file (default: stdout)
  * --sentences flag to also print sentences
- Library should be importable with reusable functions

The data generator should take as input a config file with the
following information:

  n - the number of scenes to generate
  p_one - the probability that there is just one object
  p_color - the probability that an object will have a color
  p_size - the probability that an object will have a size
  colors - list of possible colors
  sizes - list of possible sizes
  shapes - list of possible shapes
  rels - list of possible spatial relationships

The output should be JSON that represents each scene with either one
object with properties or two objects with properties and a spatial
relationship.  Any missing properties or relations should take on the
special value "none".

OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
  "scenes": [
    {
      "objects": [
        {"shape": "circle", "color": "red", "size": "none"}
      ],
      "relationship": "none"
    },
    {
      "objects": [
        {"shape": "circle", "color": "red", "size": "large"},
        {"shape": "square", "color": "none", "size": "small"}
      ],
      "relationship": "above"
    }
  ]
}

SENTENCE GENERATION:
The data generator should have a utility function that converts each
scene into a sentence by reading off non-none values in the first
object, the spatial relationship if it is not none, and the non-none
values in the second object.

Sentence format:
- No articles (a, an, the)
- Property order: SIZE, COLOR, SHAPE (when both size and color present, size comes first)
- Examples:
  * Single object: "large red circle" or "circle" or "red square"
  * Two objects: "large red circle above small square" or "circle below triangle"
